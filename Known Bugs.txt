/**********************/

Cannot noclip and report abuse as chatbox player name option not available even though crown is gold

	Check login block (return code and shit, both server and client-sided).

	Refactor while you're there.



XTEA maps are not showing up, should fix that shit.



Regions, after walking a long distance or teleporting (might just be teleporting), start to fuck up massively. Sort of hilarious, but a big problem nonetheless

	Put prints in the region and location classes. Compare with eachother, make sure they're synched.
